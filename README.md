# PDF Data Extraction and Conversion

This project extracts required information (include disaster type, location, date) and tables from a PDF file and generates a new PDF with the extracted content.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your machine.

## Installation

+ The text information extraction is based on [pdf2json](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pdf2json) library. If not installed, try:

  ````shell
  npm install pdf2json
  ````

+ The table content extraction is based on [pdfkit-table](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pdfkit-table). If not installed, try:

  ```shell
  npm install pdfkit-table
  ```

## Usage

+ Change target <u>pdf file path</u> and <u>generated file path</u> in ```src/main.js```if required:

  ````js
  const pdfPath = './test_pdf/test4.pdf';
  const jsonTextOutputPath = './jsons_generated/parsed.json';
  ````

+ To extract information and tables from a PDF file, use the `main.js` script:

  ````shell
  node src/main.js
  ````
